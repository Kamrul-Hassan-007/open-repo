Extract them both and put the wallpaper folder in Graphite theme folder if you want to  use those walls..
if not leave it..To install Graphite just run install.sh in "graphite theme" folder.

##

Graphite is a GTK theme..I used it Because the applications that i uses are GTK application not QT.
I use nwg-look app to set it up on the system.
